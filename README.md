# Project 1: Modern Analytics ELT (SQL (BigQuery)
Built end-to-end ELT from SaaS/OLTP (CDC) to warehouse; modeled star schema with dbt incremental models, snapshots, tests, docs, CI via GitHub Actions; orchestrated with Airflow
Cut pipeline runtime X%, improved freshness to [Y min], raised test coverage to Z%, enabling BI/Analytics to launch [N] new dashboards with stable SLAs

# Revenue \&\ Marketing ROI Cockpit (Power BI)
Modeled star schema (FactSales/Spend, DimDate/Product/Channel), automated ETL with Power Query & SQL; authored DAX (YoY/MoM, rolling 12M, ROAS, CAC, LTV), RLS by region, and Incremental Refresh
Cut reporting time [X hrs to Y min], improved refresh Z%; identified underperforming campaigns saving A% spend and lifted blended ROAS B

# Data Quality & Observability Starter (dbt)
Implemented schema/freshness/distribution checks with Great Expectations, wired fail-fast quality gates into dbt runs and pushed anomaly alerts to Slack/Email
Lowered data incidents P%, reduced mean-time-to-detect [M hrs to N min], and blocked [Q] bad loads from reaching BI consumers
